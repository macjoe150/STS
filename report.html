        <p> <h3>DAY 1</h3> 
          On Monday 31st January, 2022 my STS partners and I arrived on the Xavi R/C Basic School campus at 8:10am prompt. We went to greet the staff and we waited for a while for the headmaster who is in the person of Albert K. Ahiave to arrive. When he arrived, he took us around to see our assigned classrooms. Mr. Ahiave mentioned to us that the school is in short supply of teachers so the primary teachers supplement the JHS teachers. The assistant headmaster, Mr. Ajiboye Manasseh also came around and he instructed us to enter our details into a notebook that he gave us. At exactly 11: 20am, Mr. Ahiave summoned us and he introduced us to the staff. Thereafter, he took leave of us to respond to a call of duty.  Mr. Ajiboye furnished us with information about the school and we went back to our various classrooms to proceed with our observation. We left the school premises at  2: 35pm.
           <h3>DAY 2</h3> 
          Time was due once again to visit our STS partner school. We took off from campus on Monday 7th February, 2022 in the morning. We got to the Xavi R/C Basic School at 7 : 50am prompt. On that day,  I went to my class and the activity for the day was to observe GESI related issue in the class as the teacher presents lesson, the teachers used integration of ICT in lesson delivery and how he motivates and managed leaners and the mode of assessment. At exactly 8:00am my mentor commenced his lesson, in the course of the lesson he paid adequate attention to all  learners by adapting instructional strategies to meet the learning needs of all the learned in the class, he was fair in delivery and there was no discrimination.He showed a video from YouTube to the learners in the course of the lesson delivery using his laptop.
          learners who contributed ideas to the  lesson were applauded, he also used positive comments to encourage them. With respect to managing the learners he formed  a group a group of small learners and assigned them task after sometime he instructed that the group leader presents the ideas they have discussed.
          In the course of his lesson delivery, he uses oral questions to see if learners grabbed the concept been taught, he also assigned them written test. The lesson came to a close when he gave them home work. We signed out and left the school premises at 2:30pm.
          
         <h3>DAY 3</h3> 
          On Monday 14th of February 2022, in the morning we arrived on the xavi R/C basic school at 7:19am for our third STS observation. The activities lined up for the day were to go through learners duty roster, to identify the roles and responsibilities of the various positions in the classroom that helps in the smooth running of the class and how the rules and regulations were implemented in the class. I went to my assigned classroom with the help of the checklist, I was able to observe some leadership qualities in the classroom which included willing to serve others, good listening leadership skills, hardworking, goal oriented, encouraging, excellent communication skills, good decisions making skills.
          On the part of the rules and regulations in the classroom. I observe that learners asked questions in an orderly manner during lesson delivery. They showed respect for the classroom teacher, they raised their hands to be called upon before speaking, they paid attention to the teacher when he was delivering the lesson, they paid attention to classmate when ideas are been shared,  because going out without permission attract punishment  they didn’t do so, fighting in class was not allowed so they observe some calm. The class teacher assume the role as a counselor so he reprimanded them as and when they went astray, those who flaunted the classroom rules and regulations were assigned a task. I wish asking questions in orderly manner should be upheld as a foremost rule in the class because it will help in the smooth flow of the lesson. Lo and behold we ended the day’s activity and we departed at exactly 2:30pm.
        
          
         <h3>DAY 4</h3> 
          Time was due once again to visit our STS partner school for the fourth time. We took off from campus on Monday 16th May, 2022 in the morning. We got to the Xavi R/C Basic School at 7 : 48am prompt. Our activities for the day Is as follows observing legal and ethical issues of code of conduct in the teaching profession in the classroom and how this will enhance my professional development as a student teacher . I went to my assigned to observe my mentor teach and how he will exhibit ethical conduct as a teacher. While presenting his lesson, I observed that he had self respect and respect for learners and he appeared decent, he had good communication skills, he was fair and loving, he was always willing to make things better, he was approachable and accommodated all ideas in the classroom. His leadership styles positively influenced all the learners to be part of the lesson.
